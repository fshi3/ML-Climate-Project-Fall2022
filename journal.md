10.27.2022 - Thought about the data and what I can do with it. Debating whether weather prediction was a useful objective and how I would go about it. Considering changing my idea to detecting deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest using a kaggle dataset of sateille images of various locations in the Amazon Rainforest. Crafting a tool for automatic detection of deforestation can be used on sateille images to alert interested parties and authorities early on so that action can be taken.
